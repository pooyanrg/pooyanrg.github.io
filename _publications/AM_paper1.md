We consider the problem of designing lightweight load-bearing frame structures with additive manufacturability constraints. Specifically, we focus on mathematical programming approaches to finding exact globally optimal solutions, given a prespecified discrete ground structure and continuous design element dimensions. We take advantage of stiffness matrix decomposition techniques and expand on some of the existing modeling approaches, including exact Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming and its Mixed-Integer Linear Programming restrictions. We propose a (non-convex) quadratic formulation using semi-continuous variables, motivated by recent progress in state-of-the-art quadratic solvers, and demonstrate how some additive-specific restrictions can be incorporated into mathematical optimization. While we show with numerical experiments that the proposed methods significantly reduce the required solution time for finding global optima compared to other formulations, we also observe that even with these new techniques and advanced computational resources, discrete modeling of frame structures remains a tremendously challenging problem.
