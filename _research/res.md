## Research Interests: 

My research interest is mainly focused on Explainable AI (XAI) in both Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I am also interested in Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. 

## Research To Date:

As part of my Ph.D. research, I am working on Explainability in Transformers to make them editable for downstream tasks. In a submission to the CVPR 2024 conference, my first research paper included using a bottleneck stage in vision Transformers to detect changes in a pair of input images.
