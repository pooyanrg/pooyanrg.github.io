Welcome to my academic homepage! I am Pooyan. I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Auburn University, AL, under the guidance of the esteemed Dr. [Anh Nguyen](https://anhnguyen.me/research/). Before my doctoral studies, I earned my Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. During this time, I had the privilege of working with two distinguished advisors, Dr. [Ahad Harati](http://prof.um.ac.ir/a.harati/) and Dr. [Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi](http://prof.um.ac.ir/k.ghiasi/), who played a pivotal role in shaping my academic journey. I have also completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Software Engineering under the mentorship of Dr. [Kamaledin Ghiasi-Shirazi](http://prof.um.ac.ir/k.ghiasi/).
