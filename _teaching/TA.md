Probability and Statistics I
---
For this course I was a Teaching Assistant. The course instructor was [Dr. Ashkan Negahban](https://greatvalley.psu.edu/person/ashkan-negahban). The course covered introductory discussions in Probability and Statistics. 

Stochastic Optimization 
---
This course was intended as an introductory class in stochastic operations research discussing how probability and statistics can be used in analytics, decision making and mathematical modeling. It included Markov chains, queuing theory and inventory control topics. This course was taught by [Dr. Alexander Vinel](https://eng.auburn.edu/directory/azv0019). 

Dynamic Programming
---
Introduction to sequential decision making with emphasis on formulation and solution using Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms. The course covered deterministic and
stochastic dynamic programming problems in finite and infinite horizons, under the total, discounted and long run average cost criteria. This course was a grad level course taught by [Dr. Daniel F. Silva](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/directory/dfs0008).

Manufacturing Systems II 
---
This course provided an introduction to the design and operation of manufacturing systems. The focus was on using mathematical modeling and advanced analytical tools such as linear programming, simulation and statistics to analyze, control, improve and optimize several aspects of manufacturing systems. This course was taught by [Dr. Daniel F. Silva](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/directory/dfs0008).

Manufacturing Systems I
---
Classical industrial and systems engineering related to the design and evaluation of manufacturing systems and the understanding of manufacturing processes. The course was taught by [Dr. Richard Garnett](https://eng.auburn.edu/directory/rfg0004).
