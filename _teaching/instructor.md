## *Manufacturing Systems I*
Fall 2020, I had the chance to teach an undergrade course (_Manufacturing Systems I_) for which I had the full responsibility to desing the course, design the syllabus (given [here](/files/Syllabus%20%20Fall%202020%20(Rev%201).pdf)), teach the course, make the exams and manage the hybrid teaching environment. Although some of the course material were based on the ones taht I had experience with from the course that I was TA for, but, modifying everything to a hybrid class was one of the challenges that I faced. Due to COVID-19, most of the students prefered to stay at home and follow the live Zoom classroom. After each class, I edit the recorded classroom and uploaded the recording to course's website in order to make them evailable for those students who could not watch the class live. During that semester thanks to COVID-19, I overcame many challenges that were abnormal for an instructor who teach a class for the first time. Students' evaluation on the other hand showed that, those challenges were steps for the success. With their evaluations they once more reminded me that I made a right decision in choosing to pursue academic career. Below are some of the comments that I received in the anonymous evaluation form:

> *Oguz did a great job teaching this course this semester! The material was very graspable and I retained more from this class from most others I took this semester*

> *Dr. Toragay is an excellent professor. He seems to understand the material well and cares about the success if his students. I would take a class from him again. He teaches right from the slides, but the slides are content packed. He delivers the information well. The robot project could have used a little more explaining, but it was a good project and I learned a lot from it.*

> *Professor Toragay was very engaged during class. Although it is harder to teach students remotely, I felt that he did an excellent job in conveying our material.*

> *Professor Oguz did a great job on lectures and providing feedback for our group project. My only downside to this class were the labs. They were very challenging to do with the remote desktop and I do not feel like I got any beneÂ¦cial knowledge out of them by doing them online.*

> *The project and especially the labs that were assigned was very hard and inconvenient to perform giving the circumstances of this semester.*

## *Probability and Statistics I*
For this course I was a Teaching Assistant. The course instructor was [Dr. Ashkan Negahban](https://greatvalley.psu.edu/person/ashkan-negahban). The course covered introductory discussions in Probability and Statistics. 

## *Stochastic Optimization* 
This course was intended as an introductory class in stochastic operations research discussing how probability and statistics can be used in analytics, decision making and mathematical modeling. It included Markov chains, queuing theory and inventory control topics. This course was taught by [Dr. Alexander Vinel](https://eng.auburn.edu/directory/azv0019). 

## *Dynamic Programming*
Introduction to sequential decision making with emphasis on formulation and solution using Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms. The course covered deterministic and
stochastic dynamic programming problems in finite and infinite horizons, under the total, discounted and long run average cost criteria. This course was a grad level course taught by [Dr. Daniel F. Silva](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/directory/dfs0008).

## *Manufacturing Systems II* 
This course provided an introduction to the design and operation of manufacturing systems. The focus was on using mathematical modeling and advanced analytical tools such as linear programming, simulation and statistics to analyze, control, improve and optimize several aspects of manufacturing systems. This course was taught by [Dr. Daniel F. Silva](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/directory/dfs0008).

## *Manufacturing Systems I*
Classical industrial and systems engineering related to the design and evaluation of manufacturing systems and the understanding of manufacturing processes. The course was taught by [Dr. Richard Garnett](https://eng.auburn.edu/directory/rfg0004).

## *Production, Planning and Control*
> *This class challenged my abilities as a student. I really enjoyed the course overall with this instructor. I really appreciated the study review days that was implemented into the course. Not only did it prepare me for the exams but it really motivated me to study the content thoroughly and help guide me on what material I need to focus. (Helped me effectively study).*

## *Applied Stochastic Processes (Graduate level course)*
> *Dr.Oguz were so proactive and show diligence in delivering the class material and provide good platform for the student to choose project topic and also collaborative in all course work avenues.*
> *Instructor has a well versed knowledge from multiple verticals. But we did not receive any information on current applications of the study.*
<font color=red>Evaluation: 4.64/5</font>

## *Plant Layout*
> *Homework assignments shouldn't be graded so harshly in my opinion. The student is still learning the material and sacrificing their grade because of their gaps in misunderstanding is a bit unfair. Other than that I appreciate the constant effort to make sure each student understands every step.*
<font color=red>Evaluation: 4.3/5</font>

## *Simulation in System Design*
> *I feel like the in class activities shouldn't be graded based on correctness. The Simio software is intricate and its hard to follow along in class, there is a high chance that a student could miss a step or two. Even if a student is directing their full attention on each step, there are still moments in error. Because this is the first hand experience with the software students are bound to make mistakes. Their grade shouldn't reflect how well they can get the program working on their first try. The grade for these assignments should be based on effort.*
<font color=red>Evaluation: 3.7/5</font>

## *Advanced Optimization Techniques (Graduate level course)*
> *This has been my favorite class at LTU so far. I think the applications for these projects in industry are incredibly relevant and Dr. Toragay did a great job with making the homeworks relevant. The only thing I thought could be improved was a review of the key concepts from the later classes where the students presented/taught the class. It was difficult to get the correct information at times, due to some groups lack of grasping of the concepts as well as poor presentation skills.*
